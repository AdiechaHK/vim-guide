## Modes

There are 3 modes in vim editor

* normal mode (by default you will be in this mode, when you are in insert mode or visual mode press `esc` to get back to normal mode)

* visual mode (type `v` to enter in this mode)

## Moving Cursor

* `h` (left)
* `j` (down)
* `k` (up)
* `l` (right)
* `G` (to bottom of the file)
